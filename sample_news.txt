National security strategy must evolve in line with changes in geo-political order: CDS Gen Anil Chauhan
--------------------------------------------------------
International geopolitics is in flux and the national strategy should aim to absorb the changes so that it meets the challenges and exploits the opportunities, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan said on Friday.

Addressing the inauguration of the DRDO Directors' Conclave here in New Delhi, General Chauhan said that the need to perform, reform, transform, inform and conform to meet the emerging challenges.

Referring to the "Technology Requirements emerging from Theaterisation", he said superiority in technology and tactics is the need of the hour and Indian Armed Forces are investing in new technologies to win engagements ..

Highlighting the principles of jointness, integration and theaterisation, General Anil Chauhan said in the national security realm that the concept of theaterisation is a fundamental change on the anvil.

"It is one of the most ambitious changes with far-reaching implications attempted post-independence. The start of this journey depends on the first steps towards jointness and integration. Theaterisation involves creation of tri-service theatre-specific structures for an effective response along the entire spectrum of conflict," said General Anil Chauhan.

The CDS said integration in the physical domain aims to achieve a multiplier effect as it combines the unique capabilities of the Services through integrated processes and structures to increase the warfighting capability.

General Chauhan released the DRDO's second list of systems and subsystems for the industry to design, develop and manufacture, in line with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat. This second list of DRDO is in continuation of the list of 108 items released earlier. He also released the "DRDO Guidelines for Production Coordination", which outlines the mechanism for production coordination and resolution of issues associated with production of DRDO-developed military equipment/ platforms/ systems.

The guidelines bring out a two-tier mechanism to resolve issues related to production of these systems by involving designers, users, production agencies, quality agencies and other stakeholders. The initiative will further pave the way for the Indian Defence Industry to develop defence technologies/ systems towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat.

The two-day conclave is organised as a follow-up to the various Chintan Shivir meetings and a review of their outcome by Defense Minsiter Rajnath Singh.

"India Will Be $25-30 Trillion Economy By 2050": Gautam Adani:
----------------------------------------------------------------
New Delhi: India is on track to be a $25-30 trillion economy by 2050, Adani Group chief Gautam Adani said today, adding that he anticipates that India will add a trillion dollars to the GDP every 18 months within the next decade, and become the second-largest economy in the world by 2050.
India took 58 years to get to its first $ trillion GDP, 12 years to get to the next trillion and just five years for the third, he pointed out.

"India's stock market capitalisation seen growing to over $40 trillion by 2050. My belief in the growth story of our matrubhumi (motherland) has never been stronger," Mr Adani said.

While economic cycles are getting increasingly harder to predict, India's demographic dividend is expected to drive consumption and accelerate the growth of a tax-paying society at record pace, Mr Adani said while addressing shareholders at the annual general meeting of Adani Enterprises Ltd.

Despite global challenges like the climate emergency, geopolitical challenges, supply chain issues, energy volatility, and persistent inflation, Mr Adani said he believes in India's future.

"The world is continuing to be hit by multiple shocks. I see potential for a massive reset in existing global operating models," he said.
He based his prediction on a stable government, coupled with Indian demographics and strong internal demand, which he said were "a potent combination"

"A stable government is critical for any economy to implement policy, and lay the foundation for growth. We have seen the impact of several structural reforms, critical for strong, sustainable, balanced growth," Mr Adani said.
